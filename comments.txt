# Jazzmin
    Jazzmin is a modern looking Django admin theme using bootstrap 4.
    It has a custom sidebar menu with multi-level dropdowns and active classes.
    It is fully responsive and it is very easy to customize.

# Serializer
    Serializers allow complex data such as querysets
    and model instances to be converted to native Python
    datatypes that can then be easily rendered into JSON,
    XML or other content types.
    Serializers also provide deserialization,
    allowing parsed data to be converted back into
    complex types, after first validating the incoming data.
    Basically, what we try to do is to convert a Django
    model to JSON formatto access it from anywhere in
    any part of the application or to send it to the
    client (frontend).

# JWT (STATELESS)
    JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519)
    that defines a compact and self-contained way for
    securely transmitting information between parties
    as a JSON object. This information can be verified
    and trusted because it is digitally signed.
    JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm)
    or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.
    This token is a secured encrypted note containing user
    information (Flexible) and secret code known only by the website,
    it is sent with every request to the server to verify
    if its valid you're allowed to access the data or not.
    Works with different systems and apps, and it simplifies
    development.
