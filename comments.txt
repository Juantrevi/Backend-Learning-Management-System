# Jazzmin
    Jazzmin is a modern looking Django admin theme using bootstrap 4.
    It has a custom sidebar menu with multi-level dropdowns and active classes.
    It is fully responsive and it is very easy to customize.

# Serializer
    Serializers allow complex data such as querysets
    and model instances to be converted to native Python
    datatypes that can then be easily rendered into JSON,
    XML or other content types.
    Serializers also provide deserialization,
    allowing parsed data to be converted back into
    complex types, after first validating the incoming data.
    Basically, what we try to do is to convert a Django
    model to JSON formatto access it from anywhere in
    any part of the application or to send it to the
    client (frontend).
